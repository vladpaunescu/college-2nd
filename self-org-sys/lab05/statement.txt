1. Write a program that finds the optimal solution for the TSP problem.

2. Write a program that implements the Ant System algorithm for the TSP problem.

3. Simulation details:

- You will use 3 full graphs: G1 (9 nodes), G2 (10 nodes), G3 (11 nodes). These graphs are generated by your program (nodes, edges, costs) at the beginning of the simulation.

- For the Ant System algorithm, we considered fixed during the simulation (so for all the simulation experiments):
    - Q - chosen by you
    - the number of ants - chosen by you
    - NCmax = 1000

- A simulation experiment is defined by a triple (alfa, beta, ro) and can be described as follows:
    for i = 1 ... 10
        apply Ant system
The result of the simulation experiment must be the best solution (from the 10 solutions obtained during the experiment).

- For each graph you must perform 10 simulation experiments (so you must use 10 triple (alfa, beta, ro)). For each simulation experiment, you must compute the error: the difference between the cost of the solution obtained using Ant System and the cost of the optimal solution.

- For each graph, you must create a table with the errors obtained after performing the simulation experiments (the table will contain the errors for the 10 simulation experiments performed for that graph).

- In the end, you must create a comparative table that will contain, for each graph, the error given by the best simulation experiment.

- In all the 4 tables, you must also put, for each simulation experiment, the corresponding triple (alfa, beta, ro).

- The 4 tables will be included in a .pdf file.
