I've implemented the exact solution for the Travelling Salesman Problem - with opimized backtraking.
I've also implemented the standard Ant Colony Optimization algorithm and applied it in order to find the best parametrs alpha, beta, rho.
Lastly, I've implemented the discrete variant of Particle Swarm Optimization, that will be presented below:

\subsection{Discrete PSO Variant}

The solution of a particle is a permutation of all cities Example: (0, 3, 2, 1, 4).

A swap operation (i,j) exchanges the elements i, j in the permuation.
The velocity of a particle is a sequence of swap operators.
Velocity examples: – swap operator (SO)= SO(1,2) //swap first visited city with the second visited city – swap sequence (SS)=(SO(1,2,), SO(5,4), SO(5,1))
