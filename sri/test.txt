n the future, crop blight has caused civilization to regress into a failing agrarian society. Former NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) runs a farm with his father-in-law, his teenage son, and his 10-year-old daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy). Murphy believes her room is haunted by a ghost trying to communicate with her. She and Cooper discover the "ghost" is an unknown intelligence sending coded messages using gravitational waves, leaving binary coordinates in the dust that direct them to a secret NASA installation led by Professor Brand (Michael Caine). Brand reveals that a wormhole, apparently created by an alien intelligence, offers a chance for humanity's survival on a new planet. Using it, NASA's "Lazarus missions" have identified three potentially habitable planets orbiting the black hole Gargantua: Miller, Edmunds, and Mann, named after the astronauts who surveyed them. Brand recruits Cooper to pilot the spacecraft Endurance to recover the astronauts' data; if one of the planets is habitable, humanity will follow on space stations. Cooper's decision to leave devastates Murphy, and they part on bad terms.

On Endurance, Cooper joins Brand's daughter, biologist Amelia (Anne Hathaway); physicist Romilly (David Gyasi); geographer Doyle (Wes Bentley); and robots TARS (voiced by Bill Irwin) and CASE (voiced by Josh Stewart). They enter the wormhole and head to Miller, but discover the planet is so close to Gargantua that it experiences severe gravitational time dilation: each hour on the surface is seven years on Earth. They descend to the planet, which proves inhospitable as it is covered by a shallow ocean roiled by enormous tidal waves. As Amelia attempts to recover Miller's data, a wave hits, killing Doyle and delaying the shuttle's departure. When Cooper and Amelia return to Endurance, 23 years have passed.

On Earth, the adult Murphy (Jessica Chastain) is now a NASA scientist assisting Brand with the equation that will enable NASA to launch its massive space stations via gravity. On his deathbed, Brand admits he already solved the problem and determined the project is impossible; he covered up his conclusion and put his faith in a "Plan B": using fertilized embryos to start humanity anew. However, Murphy concludes that Brand's equation could work with additional data from a black hole's singularity.

Low on fuel, Endurance can only visit one more planet before returning to Earth. Amelia believes Edmunds' planet has the more promising data, but Cooper and Romilly favor Mann's planet, as Mann (Matt Damon) is still transmitting. Cooper accuses Amelia of letting her emotional attachment to Edmunds cloud her judgment, while Amelia argues they could explore both planets if Cooper would give up on returning to Earth. The team votes for Mann's planet, but they find it to be icy and inhospitable. Mann reveals that he knew Plan B was the mission's goal all along, and faked data about his planet's viability so Endurance would rescue him. Mann breaks Cooper's spacesuit visor and leaves him to die; Romilly dies when he triggers a bomb Mann set to protect his secret. Mann flees to Endurance on a shuttle, intending to proceed with Plan B on Edmunds' world. Amelia rescues Cooper on the other shuttle and they arrive at Endurance in time to witness Mann docking improperly. The airlock depressurizes, killing Mann and causing serious damage, but Cooper uses the shuttle to get Endurance under control.

Nearly out of fuel, Cooper and Amelia plan to slingshot Endurance around Gargantua on a course toward Edmunds. TARS and Cooper detach into the black hole, hoping to collect data on the singularity and propel Amelia by dropping mass from the ship. They emerge in an extra-dimensional "tesseract" where time appears as a spatial dimension and portals lead to Murphy's childhood bedroom at various times. Cooper realizes the extra-dimensional beings are future humans who have created this space so he can communicate with Murphy as the "ghost" and save humanity. Using gravitational waves, he transmits TARS's data on the singularity to the adult Murphy through Morse code, allowing her to solve Brand's equation and evacuate Earth. Years later, Cooper awakes aboard a NASA space station and reunites with the now elderly Murphy, who has led humanity's exodus. Murphy convinces Cooper to search for Amelia, who is marooned on Edmunds' planet, which is demonstrated to be habitable for humans â€“ and will become their next home.
